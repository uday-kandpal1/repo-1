Array Mastery in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to Array Mastery in DSA, a project aimed at providing hands-on examples and implementations of important array operations and algorithms. This repository is perfect for developers and learners who want to understand how arrays are used in data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems efficiently.
Introduction

Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures used in various applications. In this project, you’ll explore different operations on arrays, learn how they work, and implement algorithms that utilize arrays in DSA.

Some common problems include:

    Finding the maximum or minimum element in an array.
    Sorting arrays using algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort.
    Performing binary search on sorted arrays.
    Solving dynamic programming problems like the longest increasing subsequence.

This project includes both simple and advanced topics, making it suitable for learners at any stage of their DSA journey.
Features

    Basic Operations: Insert, delete, update, and search elements in arrays.
    Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of Bubble Sort, QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.
    Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, and variations.
    Array Manipulation: Rotation, reversal, merging of arrays, and more.
    Dynamic Programming: Solve array-based problems like the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), Maximum Subarray Sum, and others.
    Time Complexity: Explanation and analysis of the time complexity for each algorithm.

Array Operations
1. Basic Array Operations

    Insertion: Adding an element to the array at a specific position.
    Deletion: Removing an element from the array.
    Search: Finding an element in the array.
    Update: Modifying an existing element at a given index.

2. Array Reversal

    Efficiently reverse an array using O(n) time complexity.

3. Rotating an Array

    Left Rotation: Rotate the array by 'd' positions to the left.
    Right Rotation: Rotate the array by 'd' positions to the right.

4. Merging Two Sorted Arrays

    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array with O(n+m) complexity.

Algorithms Using Arrays
Sorting Algorithms

    Bubble Sort
    Selection Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Merge Sort

Searching Algorithms

    Linear Search: O(n) search on unsorted arrays.
    Binary Search: O(log n) search on sorted arrays.

Advanced Algorithms

    Kadane's Algorithm: Maximum subarray sum problem.
    Two Pointers Technique: Solving problems like finding pairs in an array that sum to a target.
    Sliding Window Technique: For problems like finding the maximum sum subarray of fixed size.
